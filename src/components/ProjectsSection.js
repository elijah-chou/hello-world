    description: "This is a side project that I worked on over the 2023-2024 winter break that was inspired by both my \
    Human AI Interaction class and also my friend's own project. I wanted to practice using GitHub's Copilot to help me \
    rapidly develop a simple, powerful chatbot while also learning to integrate Google's new Gemini Pro API into my project. \
    It was a great experience and I hope to continue working on it in the future!",

    Once a user enters their Google PaLM API key, they will be able to ask one of three different daemons \
    to give the user some feedback and/or suggestions on their writing. I built this as part of a group project \
    for CS 584: Human-AI Interaction taught by Dr. Chinmay Kulkarni at Emory University. \
    I worked on prompt engineering and the backend, while Aditya Prakash and Rayvant Sahni worked on the frontend \
    and user feedback, respectively. The accompanying code can be found on my GitHub profile. :D Hurray for AI",

    description: "I can't discuss too much about the project details since it's an internal \
    project... but I will proudly talk about some technologies I gained experience in! I worked \
    a lot with Kubernetes, Kafka, Jenkins, and Airflow for the first time. I also got a certification in Airflow \
    fundamentals! I also worked with Springboot applications and managed dependencies with Maven. I was also \
    given permission to brag that I worked and contributed significantly to a project that can save JPMorgan \
    Chase & Co. $5 million per year. Super busy but super fulfilling summer! Also participated in the firm's \
    Global Innovation Week Hackathon, and my team won 1st Place in the Atlanta tech center :D",

    description: "Throughout the Spring 23 semester, in addition to working on an honors thesis \
    I worked as a Software Engineer Student Assistant at the Georgia Tech Research Institute under \
    the Aerospace, Transportation, and Advanced Systems Lab. I mainly worked on a Python Flask web \
    application that will be used as a fuel ordering system for naval bases. Through this project, I \
    worked with an MVC framework using Python, HTML/CSS, and some JavaScript since an embedded map \
    was served as a separate React app. I also worked with Docker and learned more about containers here.",

    Earning highest honors, I worked with Dr. Davide Fossati and Dr. Arnon Hershkovitz \
    to develop and test a creativity measure on university students' code. \
    The general gist is that we parsed code into abstract syntax trees and used the tree edit distances \
    between trees to calculate a creativity measure for programs. More info can be found in my publicly \
    published thesis in the link below.",

    I unexpectedly was offered an internship and that's how I ended up working as a SWE intern in Summer 2023 :D \
    Our React-based website was our solution to Education to Employment's challenge of extending educational and employment \
    training and workshops from in-person centers to the Internet where residents living in more rural areas would be able to \
    access them without traveling to the city. We incorporated a reactive, modular design so that the web-based application \
    could be easily accessible via any digital medium and that educational content could be easily inserted into our generalized \
    tutorial/walkthrough components. The repository is private and I can't fork it, but my internship offer is hopefully enough \
    proof.",

    I mainly worked with an inventive scientist working at their AT&T Labs office in New Jersey on a proof-of-concept \
    where we attempted to create an immutable ledger of AI and ML models. I developed the ledger with the Corda blockchain \
    framework and also developed a front-end UI with Springboot and AngularJS. There's no place where you can find more \
    information since it's all stored in a private, corporate repository, but this was a great experience nevertheless!",

      taught by Dr. Davide Fossati at Emory University. We built a Java-based Audio Visualizer program \
      that is aimed at inducing feelings/emotions of choice with shapes, sounds, and colors. Audio visualizations \
      were created with the help of the Java-based Processing library. I worked on the back-end and helped \
      the team implement JDBC connections to a Google Cloud Platform hosted MySQL server to help track user \
      usage. Our team was led by Noah Okada and consisted of Matthew Joesoep, Asuka Li, Ameer Husary, \

    description:
      "The agent-based model implemented with NetLogo attempts to accurately model the relationship and interactions \
      \between varroa mites and honey bees. Varroa mites introduced to beehives transmit diseases such as the Deformed \
      Wing Virus (DWV) to bee larvae, and as the mites populate exponentially the overall bee population becomes increasingly \
      affected by the DWV. Essential oil treatments (ex. thyme and spearmint) were introduced to the model to test how \
      reapplication times of oils can affect virus transmission and total varroa mite count within an arbitrary span of time. \
      Further refinement of the model could help beekeepers predict an essential oil cocktail that would be the most effective \
      against varroa mite infestation.",
